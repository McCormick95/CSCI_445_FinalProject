# CSCI_445_FinalProject
Final project for Image Processing and Analysis

Segment a volume of images for object classification. To develop the algorithm, a training volume is
provided along with corresponding ground truth labels. Multiple strategies should be explored and
synthesized to improve the results. Programs will be evaluated for clarity, classification accuracy, and
relevance of design choices.
[BW] = Project5A_XX(f)
Write a function to segment an image f from the volume and return the segmentation BW, a logical
image.
[ACC, F1] = Project5B_XX(G, BW)
Write a function to calculate two measures to evaluate results between a segmentation BW and the
ground truth image G. Pixel accuracy ACC and F-score F1 are computed based on the true/false
positives/negatives
